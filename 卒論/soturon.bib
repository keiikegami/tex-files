abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved superhuman performance in a growing number of tasks, including the classical games of chess, shogi, and Go, but understanding and explaining AI remain challenging. This paper studies the machine-learning algorithms for developing the game AIs, and provides their structural interpretations. Specifically, chess-playing Deep Blue is a calibrated value function, whereas shogi-playing Bonanza represents an estimated value function via Rust's (1987) nested fixed-point method. AlphaGo's "supervised-learning policy network" is a deep neural network (DNN) version of Hotz and Miller's (1993) conditional choice probability estimates; its "reinforcement-learning value network" is equivalent to Hotz, Miller, Sanders, and Smith's (1994) simulation method for estimating the value function. Their performances suggest DNNs are a useful functional form when the state space is large and data are sparse. Explicitly incorporating strategic interactions and unobserved heterogeneity in the data-generating process would further improve AIs' explicability.},

The application in this paper represents one of the first attempts to test mixed-strategy behavior using data generated outside of a controlled experiment. The authors analyze the complexities that arise in testing basic hypotheses in the presence of heterogeneity across kickers and goalies. They note which hypotheses are testable when the researcher has only a limited number of kicks per goalie--kicker pair, and they introduce and test restrictions on the model that lead to a richer set of testable hypotheses given the limitations of data. Although there are clear advantages provided by a well-conducted laboratory experiment, testing game theory in the real world may provide unique insights. The penalty kick data the authors examine more closely corroborates the predictions of theory than past laboratory experiments would have led the authors to expect.

abstract = {We examine the identification power that (Nash) equilibrium assumptions play in conducting inference about parameters in some simple games. We focus on three static games in which we drop the Nash equilibrium assumption and instead use rationalizability as the basis for strategic play. The first example examines a bivariate discrete game with complete information of the kind studied in entry models. The second example considers the incomplete-information version of the discrete bivariate game. Finally, the third example considers a first-price auction with independent private values. In each example, we study the inferential question of what can be learned about the parameter of interest using a random sample of observations, under level-k rationality, where k is an integer ≥ 1. As k increases, our identified set shrinks, limiting to the identified set under full rationality or rationalizability (as k → ∞). This is related to the concepts of iterated dominance and higher-order beliefs, which are incorporated into the econometric analysis in our framework. We are then able to categorize what can be learned about the parameters in a model under various maintained levels of rationality, highlighting the roles of different assumptions. We provide constructive identification results that lead naturally to consistent estimators.},

Simplifying independent-actions and environmental-equilvalence conditions imply that the numbers of players of each type are independent Poisson random variables. Equilibria of such Poisson games are defined and proven to exist. Formulas for approximating the equilibria of large Poisson games are derived, and are applied to a voting game in which participation is costly.

abstract = {A bivariate simultaneous discrete response model which is a stochastic representation of equilibria in a two-person discrete game is studied. The presence of multiple equilibria in the underlying discrete game maps into a region for the exogenous variables where the model predicts a nonunique outcome. This is an example of an incomplete econometric structure. Economists using this model have made simplifying assumptions to avoid multiplicity. I make a distinction between incoherent models and incomplete models, and then analyse the model in the presence of multiple equilibria, showing that the model contains enough information to identify the parameters of interest and to obtain a well defined semiparametric estimator. I also show that the latter is consistent and x/n normal. Moreover, by exploiting the presence of multiplicity, one is able to obtain a more efficient estimator than the existing method.},

Using Census data on more than 15,000 plants, I estimate a model of investment and entry in oligopolistic markets. These estimates are used to simulate the effect of eliminating short-term local demand changes. A policy of smoothing the volatility of demand has a market expansion effect: The model predicts a 39{\%} increase in the number of plants in the industry. Since bigger markets have both more plants and larger plants, a demand- smoothing fiscal policy would increase the share of large plants by 20{\%}. Finally, the policy of smoothing demand reduces entry and exit by 25{\%}, but has no effect on the rate at which firms change their size.},

Specifically, we model the payoffs of games where a researcher observes qualitative or censored information about agents' decisions and payoffs. These models extend single-person qualitative choice models introduced by McFadden (1974) and others to multiple-person choice problems. The equations describing players' equilibrium strategies depend on the game's structure and the equilibrium solution concept. We show that one can describe the equilibria of a simultaneous-move Nash game with a linear system of dummy endogenous variables. We also show that sequential-move and cooperative models have different, but related, econometric structures. A series of applied examples address identification and estimation issues. These examples include models of market entry, technology adoption, tax auditing, and cooperative family labor supply.},

In industries where fixed costs are an important de-terminant of market structure, this static analysis ignores the dynamic effects of the regulation on entry, investment, and market power. I evaluate the welfare costs of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the U.S. Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a dynamic model of oligopoly in the tradition of Ericson and Pakes (1995). Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary finding is that the Amendments have significantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between {\$}810M and {\$}3.2B in product market surplus. A static analysis misses the welfare penalty on consumers, and obtains the wrong sign of the welfare effects on incumbent firms.},

We conduct a rare such test using eld data from the Swedish lowest unique positive integer (LUPI) game. In the LUPI game, players pick positive integers and whoever chose the lowest unique number wins a xed prize. Theoretical equilibrium predictions are derived assuming Poisson- distributed uncertainty about the number of players, and tested using both eld and laboratory data. The eld and lab data show similar patterns. Despite various deviations from equilibrium, there is a surprising degree of convergence toward equilibrium. Initial responses can be rationalized by a cognitive hierarchy model and convergence toward equilibrium by a simple learning-by-imitation model.},

abstract = {M achines are increasingly doing " intelligent " things: Facebook recognizes faces in photos, Siri understands voices, and Google translates websites. The fundamental insight behind these breakthroughs is as much statis-tical as computational. Machine intelligence became possible once researchers stopped approaching intelligence tasks procedurally and began tackling them empirically. Face recognition algorithms, for example, do not consist of hard-wired rules to scan for certain pixel combinations, based on human understanding of what constitutes a face. Instead, these algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function f (x) that predicts the pres-ence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: Are these algorithms merely applying standard techniques to novel and large datasets? If there are fundamentally new empirical tools, how do they fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? 1 We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Central to our understanding is that machine learning 1 In this journal, Varian (2014) provides an excellent introduction to many of the more novel tools and " tricks " from machine learning, such as decision trees or cross-validation.
